Statistics
==========

.. sectionauthor:: Travis E. Oliphant

SciPy has a tremendous number of basic statistics routines with more
easily added by the end user (if you create one please contribute it).
All of the statistics functions are located in the sub-package
:mod:`scipy.stats` and a fairly complete listing of these functions
can be had using ``info(stats)``.


Random Variables
----------------

There are two general distribution classes that have been implemented
for encapsulating continuous random variables and discrete random
variables. Over 80 continuous random variables and 10 discrete random
variables have been implemented using these classes. The list of the
random variables available is in the docstring for the stats sub-
package. A detailed description of each of them is also located in the
files continuous.lyx and discrete.lyx in the stats sub-directories.
